### Maching Learning Using the Following Models:

- Decision Tree Regressor Model
- KNN Model

## Models Evaluated & Results
- Decision Tree Regressor Model (Testing Set): 0.8982785602503912
- Tuned Decision Tree Regressor Model (Testing Set):0.9374021909233177
- kNN Model (Testing Set):0.9366197183098591
- Tuned kNN Model (Testing Set):0.9374021909233177

## Model Performance

Overall, the best model is definitely the tuned KNN Model. Even though they both have same score after the tuned but  before the tuned it has better score than the decision tree.
